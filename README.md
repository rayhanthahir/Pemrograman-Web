#Pemrograman Web

This repository content my previous work on web programming project as part of my web programming course. The project involves creating a website using various web technologies and programming languages.

The goal of the project is to apply the concepts and skills learned during the course to develop a functional and interactive web solution. This may involve designing and implementing features such as user authentication, database integration, dynamic content generation, responsive design, and other web development best practices.

The programming languages and technologies used for the project will depend on the requirements of the course and the project specifications. This may include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end development, and server-side technologies such as PHP for the back-end development. Additionally, the project may involve working with databases like MySQL for data storage and retrieval.

By working on this web programming project, I aim to enhance my skills in web development, gain practical experience in building web applications, and understand the challenges and considerations involved in developing robust and user-friendly websites.
